- How will the changes be tested? The changes should be tested in a non-production environment before moving to production. The non-production environment should ideally mimic production as closely as possible to minimize risks.
- How to ensure the changes do not negatively affect the cluster? Test the changes in a non-production environment first. Once changes are applied, the cluster should be monitored using tools like Prometheus and Grafana to ensure everything continues to work as expected. Additionally, in a production system, canary testing could be used to redirect a smaller portion of the traffic to an environment with changes applied to ensure stability before allowing all traffic.
- Rollback Instructions: Changes like this should always include rollback instructions to allow the system to be restored to previous state in case of failure. The rollback plan should include detailed instructions on how to revert every change applied so that the system can be operational again using previous settings.
